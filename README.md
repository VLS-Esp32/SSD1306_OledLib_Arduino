SSD1306_OledLib_Arduino â€“ universal library OLED Display based on SSD1306 controller for Arduino IDE support Arduino AVR, esp32, esp8266 platforms.

Warning! Supports only I2C interface, 128x64 display; may work with other displays but with potential issues, for changing target resolution  required files edit.

Library initially designed for esp32 with emphasis on performance, perfectly fits for game designing.  Supported functions: setting brightness, turning ON/OFF, pixelated rendering, rendering graphical primitive, bitmap rendering, text rendering (now available only one font 7x13) 
For library working required min 1.5 KB RAM may have troubles on another 
AVR microcontroller because initially designed for esp32 but it supports esp8266 and AVR how a secondary what can affect on performance and will be in progress . For familiarization with library functions look examples and Class_description.txt
